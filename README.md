# Instruction

## Firstly, you need to turn on [Backend](https://github.com/Rikki278/testTaskBackend/tree/master)

## When Backend is working you can turn on Frontend
For this you need to copy project to your IDE (for example WebStorm)

After that, you need to open console in project path and write: ***npm install --global yarn***

Then we need to install all our libraries by command: ***yarn install*** (npm install don't work, I don't know why)

When yarn is installed, you can write ***yarn start*** and Frontend will start

## How to run tests
You need to write in console in project path: ***npm run test:e2e***
